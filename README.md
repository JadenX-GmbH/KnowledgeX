# KNOWLEDGEX

We build KnowledgeX (KX) as a trustworthy marketplace for data science. This means data owners can outsource data science tasks to independent contractors without risking data misuse. Independent data scientists can bid on proposed tasks without getting prior access to confidential data. Currently data markets are hampered by confidentiality requirements due to competitive (e.g., cost data) or regulatory (e.g., personal data) considerations. Data scientists have to be employed in-house or are contractually restricted by non-disclosure stipulations, which tend to be ambiguous and costly to enforce.
KX aims to solve this problem via a process where data privacy, and contract fulfillment are technologically guaranteed, so the need for non-disclosure agreements does not arise. Therefore, we leverage the following technologies:

Emerging technologies:

- Blockchain and Smart Contracts
- Decentralized Cloud Computing 
- Trusted Execution Environments

Established technologies:

- Web Applications
- PKI 
- Microservice Backend


The state of the art was analyzed in detail in D2. For more information be referred to that document.   

Our contributions to the state of the art are that we build a platform with decentralization and transparency in mind using distributed ledger technologies and trusted execution environments. Furthermore, we see KX as the building block for many other applications. Within the ONTOCHAIN ecosystem we will expose a variety of different interfaces that ONTOCHAIN application developers may use for their own apps.
